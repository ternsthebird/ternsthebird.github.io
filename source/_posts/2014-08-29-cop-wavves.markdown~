You wake up on a warm summer day and hum a tune as you eat your breakfast.  
You call up your friend, and see if he can hang out today.  
He can't, so you go find something else to do.  
You decide to do something naughty.  
  
<!-- more -->
  
You did it, and feel bad, so you seek your friend's advice.  
He tells you to relax.  
There is nothing you can do to undo your wrong.  
Relax and enjoy the warm summer day.

this song reminds me of a game by terry cavanagh: [hero's adventure](http://www.kongregate.com/games/TerryCavanagh_B/heros-adventure)  
  
if the song were an image, it might look like this:
