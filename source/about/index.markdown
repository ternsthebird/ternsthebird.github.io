Terns The Bird's Blog of Awesome is ran by two lame dudes (Matt and Matthew) that enjoy things that
most 'ordinary' people do not. This includes, but is not limited to, unique and/or bad music,
mumblecore and experimental films, and developing games that are too hard for most
people.
  
You can follow them on Twitter if you want. Maybe they say offensive things, or maybe not,
we aren't too sure of the mindsets that the future will bring these two rapidly devolving humans.
The future looks pretty bleak for these two, honestly.
